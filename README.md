# python-log-ip-parser
<h2>About The Project</h2>
In this project I created a simple python script that can parse .txt log files and find what address appeared the most in the given sample and how many times. I stayed away from libarys that required improting that did most of couting and sort for me and instead using dictonarys and sets.
